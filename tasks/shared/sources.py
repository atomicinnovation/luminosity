"""Shared source-file discovery for the format and lint task families.

Both families scan an identical set of shell files (`*.sh`, minus `workspaces/`
(jj checkouts), plus the explicitly-listed extensionless CLI script) so format
and lint never disagree about what is in scope.

Discovery is a filesystem walk that honours the repository-root `.gitignore`,
deliberately VCS-agnostic: `git ls-files` is blind inside a jj workspace (git
resolves to the parent repo, whose index does not track the workspace), which
silently emptied the scan and let unformatted scripts reach CI. A plain walk
behaves identically under git checkouts (CI) and jj workspaces (local).

Only the root `.gitignore` is honoured, not nested ones — sufficient here
because every ignored shell script lives under a root-ignored tree (e.g.
`node_modules/`). Revisit with per-directory spec layering if a nested
`.gitignore` ever needs to hide a `.sh` file.
