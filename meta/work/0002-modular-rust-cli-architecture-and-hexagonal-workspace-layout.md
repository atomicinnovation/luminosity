# 0002: Modular Rust CLI Architecture & Hexagonal Workspace Layout

**Kind**: Spike
**Status**: Done
**Priority**: High
**Author**: Toby Clemson

## Summary

Resolve how to structure the Luminosity Rust CLI as a modular, git-style command
over a hexagonal core, evaluating current options on merit, so the dependent
scaffold, distribution, and spike-dependent ADR stories proceed on settled
foundations. Time-boxed to 3 days.

## Context

The epic (0001) commits to a thin CLI over a ports-and-adapters core, presented
as a single `luminosity` command that dispatches to on-demand sub-binaries. The
author is not deeply familiar with structuring a modularised Rust CLI or
splitting crates across CLI / domain / persistence, so this spike de-risks those
choices before the scaffold story begins. The accelerator's solved approach is
one input among several — the spike evaluates alternatives rather than adopting
it by default.

## Requirements

Research questions to resolve, time-boxed to **3 days**:

- **Crate split & dependency direction.** Confirm the lean `core` (domain +
  ports as traits + application) / `adapters` (port impls) / `cli` (composition
  root) workspace layout, and how the inward dependency direction is enforced.
  (Research finding: the Cargo dependency graph is itself the primary enforcement
  — `core` simply does not depend on `adapters`/I/O crates and a violation won't
  compile — reinforced by a `cargo-deny` ban-list keeping infra crates out of
  `core`. No ArchUnit-equivalent exists for Rust. Reference: howtocodeit/hexarch,
  which models the trait/`Service` core within a single crate — evaluate whether
  the multi-crate split earns its keep now or later.)
- **Git-style dispatch.** Validate clap 4.x `allow_external_subcommands` /
  `#[command(external_subcommand)]` collecting `Vec<OsString>` (not `String`, to
  pass non-UTF-8 args); first positional as subcommand, everything after handed
  off verbatim. Decide how to synthesise `--help`/a plugin listing (clap won't
  generate help for external subcommands) and `exec` on Unix vs spawn+wait on
  Windows. Compare rustup's shim/proxy model and uv's resolve-once-and-cache
  model.
- **On-demand launcher.** Decide the fetch → verify → cache → exec pipeline:
  `reqwest`(rustls) or `self_update`(rustls feature) for download, `sha2` for
  checksum, signature verification (zipsign/minisign), a managed bin dir for
  caching, `self-replace` for the launcher's own self-update. Confirm
  `default-features = false` + rustls throughout (native-tls pulls OpenSSL on
  Linux and breaks musl-static).
- **Cross-compile & distribution (scan, defer detail to the distribution
  story).** Note current best practice — `cargo-zigbuild` for musl-static/macOS
  cross, `cross` as fallback for awkward native deps, `dist` (formerly
  cargo-dist, v0.32+) for signed/checksummed per-platform artifacts — and
  confirm which of these the accelerator already uses before re-selecting.

Output: a written recommendation with a decision, evaluating the alternatives
above, recorded directly in this spike work item (a `Recommendation` section
added when the spike concludes). The spike-dependent ADRs (decisions 9–10) cite
this work item, and the scaffold and distribution stories reference it when they
are implemented. A throwaway proof-of-concept of the dispatch/launcher exec path
is optional, not required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given the 3-day time-box, when the spike concludes, then this work item
      contains a Recommendation section naming a chosen crate split, dispatch
      mechanism, launcher pipeline, and cross-compile/distribution toolchain,
      each with the alternatives considered and the rationale for the choice.
- [ ] The Recommendation explicitly states whether the multi-crate
      core/adapters/cli split is adopted now or deferred, and how the inward
      dependency direction is enforced.
- [ ] The spike-dependent ADR(s) for decisions 9–10 cite this work item, and the
      scaffold and distribution stories reference it when implemented.

## Open Questions

- Whether the hexagonal split starts multi-crate or begins single-crate
  (hexarch-style) and splits later — to be decided by the recommendation.

## Dependencies

- Blocks: scaffold story (0007), distribution story (0008), spike-dependent ADR
  story (0005).
- Blocked by: none.
- Parent: epic 0001.

## Assumptions

- The hexagonal split is crate-level, not module-level (per the epic's Technical
  Notes) — though the spike may recommend a single-crate start, given the leading
  reference (hexarch) does hexagonal well within one crate.

## Technical Notes

- clap 4.x external-subcommand support is stable and ergonomic; ignore older
  clap 2/3 `AppSettings` workarounds in stale articles.
- rustls + webpki-roots keeps the launcher independent of the host cert store and
  statically linkable; audit the dep tree so no transitive dep re-enables
  `default-tls`.
- `self_update` is steady but low-velocity and oriented at self-replacement; for
  a multi-sub-binary launcher, compose download/verify/cache primitives directly
  and use `self-replace` only for the launcher's own update.

## Drafting Notes

- Kind set to `spike` because the epic frames this as resolving an unknown via
  research with a written recommendation, not a deliverable.
- Latitude set to genuine evaluation of alternatives (per the author); the
  accelerator is one input, not the default.
- Output framed so the recommendation is recorded in this spike work item itself
  (per the author); dependent stories and ADRs reference this work item rather
  than the decisions being copied into them.
- Enriched with web research (clap 4.x dispatch, rustls launcher, hexarch,
  cargo-zigbuild/dist) current as of mid-2026.

## References

- Source: `meta/work/0001-baseline-architecture-and-engineering-guard-rails.md`
- Research: clap external subcommands (docs.rs/clap 4.6.x); rustup proxy/shim
  model; uv tool caching; howtocodeit/hexarch (hexagonal in Rust); cargo-zigbuild
  v0.23; dist (formerly cargo-dist) v0.32; self_update / self-replace; rustls vs
  native-tls.

## Spike Outcome

- **Date**: 2026-06-23
- **Time spent vs box**: Concluded well within the 3-day time-box (agent-driven
  research + collaborative discussion; no prototype required).
- **Verdict**: All four research areas resolved. The CLI is a Cargo workspace
  decomposed **by bounded context** (not the brief's single `core`/`adapters`
  split), dispatching git-style via clap external subcommands to on-demand
  static sub-binaries fetched and verified (sha256 + minisign) by a Rust
  launcher, cross-compiled with `cargo-zigbuild` and released via the
  accelerator's proven hand-rolled `gh` pipeline.

This recommendation supersedes the brief's working assumption of a
`core`/`adapters`/`cli` crate split: investigation showed sub-commands are
distinct **subdomains** (bounded contexts) with divergent dependency profiles,
not different adapters onto one shared core — so the decomposition axis is
subdomain-first, hexagonal-within. See Recommendation §1.

## Recommendation

### 1. Crate split & dependency direction — workspace now, hexagon per subdomain, split later

**Decision.** Structure the CLI as a **Cargo workspace decomposed by bounded
context (subdomain)**, not as one shared hexagonal core with sub-commands as
adapters. A workspace is required regardless, because the git-style model ships
**independently-fetched sub-binaries** — and multiple binaries from a single
package would force one shared dependency set and one version, defeating the
lean on-demand goal. The decomposition therefore runs on two orthogonal axes:

- **Binary axis** — one crate per independently-shippable sub-binary
  (`luminosity-<sub>`), each its own composition root.
- **Layering axis** — within each subdomain, hexagonal layers as *modules*.

Layout:

- **`kernel`** — a thin, deliberately dependency-light crate for genuinely
  cross-cutting concerns (error taxonomy, the config-access contract, the
  dispatch/launcher contract, logging). Admitting anything with a dependency
  tail is resisted, because everything links it.
- **Each subdomain** (e.g. `ads`, `video`) — its own hexagon, starting as a
  **single crate** with `domain` / `application` (ports as traits — *both*
  inbound/driving and outbound/driven ports live in application/domain) and
  separate `inbound/` + `outbound/` adapter modules. Split internally into
  crates only under pressure (reuse, or divergent heavy adapter deps).
- **`config`** — a deliberately **shared** crate that other subdomains may
  depend on, split into **`config`** (domain + application + ports) and
  **`config-adapters`** (outbound readers; pulls serde/toml/fs). Consumers
  depend only on the light `config` crate; the outbound adapters are wired at
  the composition root. (Composition-root **Model 1**: each sub-binary wires its
  own `config-adapters` — their deps are light. Model 2, where the launcher
  resolves config once and injects it, is held in reserve if resolution becomes
  expensive.)
- **`cli`** — the `luminosity` launcher binary; depends on `kernel` (+ `config`
  for the built-in `config` command), never on a subdomain.

**Multi-crate now or later?** The *workspace* and the *per-subdomain* split are
adopted **now** (forced by independent sub-binaries). Splitting the hexagonal
*layers* of a single subdomain into separate crates is **deferred** until a
second consumer or a heavy divergent adapter set appears — matching the canonical
reference (howtocodeit/hexarch is a single crate with `domain`/`inbound`/
`outbound` modules) and the broader Rust consensus (Tokio's crate *merge* is the
cautionary tale; splitting later is cheap, over-splitting early is not).

**Enforcing the inward dependency direction (layered, mostly on stable):**

- **Crate boundaries are the primary enforcement** — once layers/contexts are
  separate crates, the Cargo dependency graph makes a violation fail to compile
  (`core`/`config`/`kernel` simply do not depend on outer crates). `cargo-deny`
  ban-lists keep infrastructure crates out of the light crates' closures.
- **`cargo-pup`** (DataDog; the closest ArchUnit-equivalent for *intra-crate*
  module-import rules) runs in **local (`mise run check`) and standard CI as a
  blocking check**. This accepts a **pinned-nightly check lane** (cargo-pup hooks
  compiler internals); the **product build and all other required checks stay on
  stable** — the shipped binary never touches nightly. The nightly is pinned in
  `mise.toml` and bumped deliberately.
- A **CI grep tripwire** (forbidding `use crate::{adapters,inbound,outbound}`
  from `domain` modules) is the zero-dependency floor inside leaf crates.

**Alternatives considered.** (a) Single shared `core` crate with sub-commands as
adapters — *rejected*: a subdomain's heavy deps (e.g. video codecs) would land in
`core`'s closure and bleed into every binary. (b) Multi-crate layer split per
subdomain from day one — *deferred*: pays the interface/coordination cost the
community warns against before a second consumer exists. (c) Feature-gating one
monolithic `core` to contain dependency bleed — *rejected*: fragile, recouples
everything into one versioned crate, fights Cargo. (d) Relying on module
visibility alone for direction — *rejected*: visibility controls exposure, not
who imports.

**Evidence.** howtocodeit/hexarch (single crate, `domain`/`inbound`/`outbound`
modules, ports as traits); Tokio crate-merge cautionary tale (corrode.dev);
flosse/clean-architecture-with-rust and the Barrage "banker" tutorial
(multi-crate examples, Cargo graph enforces inward deps); DataDog/cargo-pup
(intra-crate import lints, v0.1.x, nightly-pinned); cargo-deny bans; Rust Project
Primer (workspace trade-offs).

### 2. Git-style dispatch — clap external subcommands, Unix-only

**Decision.** Use clap 4.x derive **`#[command(external_subcommand)]
External(Vec<OsString>)`**: the first element is the subcommand name, the rest
are forwarded verbatim. `Vec<OsString>` (not `String`) preserves non-UTF-8 args.
The derive attribute alone enables external dispatch (no manual
`allow_external_subcommands`) — *confirm on the pinned clap version at scaffold
time (0007)*.

- **Built-in vs external.** `version` and `config` are **built-in** subcommands
  compiled into `luminosity`; external dispatch is purely the *growth*
  mechanism for on-demand subdomains.
- **Platform/exec model.** **Unix `exec` only** (`CommandExt::exec`,
  process-replacing — exit codes and signals propagate naturally). **Windows is
  out of scope**, since epic 0001's four target triples are all Unix
  (`darwin-arm64/x64`, `linux-arm64/x64` musl); this drops the entire Windows
  spawn+wait/Ctrl-C path the brief framed.
- **Help & listing synthesis.** clap cannot list external subcommands, so render
  clap's built-in help plus a synthesised "external subcommands" section built
  by scanning the managed cache dir **and the release manifest's `description`
  field** (the manifest the launcher already needs for fetch+verify — one extra
  field, no executing untrusted binaries to introspect them). Per-command
  `--help` is **delegated** by re-exec'ing the child with `--help` (cargo's
  convention) — breadth from the manifest, depth from the binary.
- **Caching model.** uv-style **resolve-once-and-cache** (fits a single entry
  point far better than rustup's per-tool shims). Managed cache dir scanned
  first, fetch-on-miss, keyed by name+version+checksum; exact path deferred to
  0008.

**Alternatives considered.** rustup shim/proxy model — *rejected* for a
single-entry-point CLI (its per-tool-on-PATH benefit doesn't apply); multicall /
busybox single-fat-binary — *rejected*: grows monolithically and ships every
subdomain's deps to everyone, the opposite of on-demand. Stale clap 2/3
`AppSettings` advice ignored.

**Evidence.** clap `git-derive.rs` example & derive cookbook; `git`/`cargo`/
`kubectl plugin`/`gh extension` listing patterns (`cargo --list`'s missing
third-party descriptions — cargo#10662 — is the gap the manifest closes);
`std::os::unix::process::CommandExt::exec`; rustup vs uv caching models.

### 3. On-demand launcher — Rust in-binary, thin bash bootstrap

**Decision.** Fetch → verify → cache → exec for sub-binaries lives **inside the
Rust `luminosity` binary** (the `cli` crate), not in bash. A **thin bash
bootstrap** (simplified from the accelerator's `launch-server.sh`) fetches the
`luminosity` binary itself on first use; thereafter the Rust launcher owns
everything.

- **HTTP/TLS stack.** **`reqwest` + rustls, workspace-wide** (`default-features =
  false`, `rustls-tls`): blocking in the launcher, async in subdomains that need
  it. Chosen over `ureq` because reqwest covers **both sync and async** from one
  dependency (ureq is sync-only), giving workspace uniformity; the cost is that
  blocking reqwest pulls `tokio` into the launcher (acceptable on musl-static).
  **rustls throughout is mandatory** — native-tls/OpenSSL breaks musl-static.
- **Verification.** `sha2` checksum verified on fetch **and re-verified on every
  launch** before exec (the accelerator's cheap belt-and-suspenders), against a
  version-coherent manifest shipped with the plugin — **plus minisign** (see §4).
- **Self-update.** **None.** The plugin-update mechanism drives the launcher
  version (new plugin version → bootstrap fetches new launcher; sub-binaries
  re-fetch on manifest hash change). `self-replace` is dropped from the brief.

**Alternatives considered.** Bash launcher wholesale (port the accelerator's
shell pipeline extended to sub-binaries) — *rejected*: pushes dispatch/launch
logic into untestable bash on a 3.2 floor. `ureq` — *rejected* on the
sync+async uniformity criterion. `self_update`/`self-replace` — *rejected*: the
plugin upgrade already replaces the launcher.

**Evidence (accelerator, analysed directly).** Its launcher is bash + curl +
sha256 caching into the plugin's `bin/` and `nohup`-ing a *daemon* — it does
**not** model a git-style sub-binary CLI, so Luminosity genuinely diverges here;
its *distribution* half (§4) ports cleanly, its *launcher* half does not.

### 4. Cross-compile & distribution — port the accelerator pipeline + minisign

**Decision (scan; detail deferred to story 0008).**

- **Cross-compile** with **`cargo-zigbuild`** for the four targets
  (`aarch64/x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`) — proven
  in the accelerator, handles musl-static + macOS cross from one host. `cross`
  not needed (the launcher is pure Rust + rustls, no awkward native deps).
- **Release orchestration**: **port the accelerator's hand-rolled approach** —
  Python invoke tasks + `gh` release with re-download-and-re-verify + **version
  coherence** across `plugin.json` / `Cargo.toml` / the manifest. Chosen over
  **`dist` (cargo-dist)**, which is oriented at a fixed set of workspace binaries
  released together and would fight the individually-fetched-sub-binary +
  per-command-manifest model; it also adds tooling the accelerator deliberately
  avoids, and the invoke infrastructure already exists in this repo.
- **Integrity & signing**: sha256 + TLS + in-repo manifest **plus minisign**.
  Sign each released artifact with minisign, embed the public key in the
  launcher, and verify the detached `.minisig` **in-process via `minisign-verify`**
  (mature, zero-dependency, pure-Rust, sync — ideal for a lean static launcher),
  with **no `gh` dependency on the user's machine**.

**Alternatives considered for signing.** (A) In-process verification of the SLSA
provenance already attested by `actions/attest-build-provenance`, via
`sigstore-verify` — *parked*: technically possible without `gh`, but the crates
are pre-1.0, pull a heavy native tree (`aws-lc-rs`, awkward for musl-static),
require periodic trust-root re-embedding, and the one production in-process
attempt (`jdx/sigstore-verification`, used by **mise**) was **archived in May
2026** after repeated breakage. Revisit when `sigstore-verify` reaches a stable
1.0 — it is the strictly stronger "who built it" claim. (C) sha256 + TLS only
(the accelerator's current floor) — *rejected as the ceiling*: TLS authenticates
the CDN, not the build; retained only as the integrity layer *under* minisign.

**Evidence.** Accelerator `tasks/build.py` (cargo-zigbuild, four triples),
`tasks/github.py` (gh release + re-verify), version coherence; `minisign-verify`
0.2.5 (zero-dep, jedisct1) and `minisign`/`rsign2` for the release side;
sigstore-rs 0.14 (experimental) / prefix-dev `sigstore-verify` (0.1.x);
jdx/sigstore-verification archival; GitHub offline-attestation docs.

## Residual Risks & Open Questions

- **cargo-pup nightly lane (blocking).** A nightly bump that breaks cargo-pup
  blocks all merges, local and CI. *Mitigation:* pin the exact nightly in
  `mise.toml` and bump deliberately. *Trigger to revisit:* if the lane proves
  fragile in practice, downgrade cargo-pup from blocking to advisory while
  keeping crate-boundary + grep enforcement.
- **minisign key management.** A new Ed25519 keypair must be generated,
  protected (CI release secret), and rotated; a leaked private key forges
  releases, and minisign proves "signed by our key", not "built by our
  workflow". *Owner:* distribution story 0008 defines key storage, rotation
  policy, and `.minisig` publishing.
- **Provenance verification deferred (option A).** *Trigger to revisit:* prefix-
  dev's `sigstore-verify` reaching a stable 1.0 with a ring/rustls backend and an
  embedded-trust-root offline verify path — at which point in-process SLSA
  provenance verification becomes the preferred strengthening over minisign.
- **clap derive external-subcommand behaviour.** Low risk; *confirm* the derive
  attribute enables external dispatch without a manual builder call on the
  pinned clap version when the scaffold (0007) is built.
- **Config composition-root Model 1 → Model 2.** *Trigger to revisit:* if config
  resolution becomes expensive or a single per-invocation source of truth is
  wanted, move resolution into the launcher and inject it (sub-binaries then
  depend on `config` core only).
- **Exact cache/bin directory path** for fetched sub-binaries (XDG data dir vs
  plugin `bin/`) is deferred to distribution story 0008.
