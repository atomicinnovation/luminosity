# ADR-0001: Skills-vs-CLI Division of Labour

**Date**: 2026-06-24
**Status**: Accepted
**Author**: Toby Clemson

## Context

Luminosity is a Claude Code plugin. Its shipped product is a set of skills,
agents, hooks, templates, and scripts that Claude Code loads, with deterministic
logic expressed in shell scripts and Python build tasks.

Large language models are excellent at probabilistic work — reasoning,
generation, summarisation, judgement — but are, by nature, non-deterministic,
costly per token, and unreliable for exact procedural logic such as parsing,
file manipulation, version-coherence enforcement, or fixed multi-step
transforms. Deterministic logic expressed in skill prose or inline shell is hard
to test, slow, token-expensive, and error-prone, and it accretes ad hoc as the
plugin grows. This decision is grounded in direct experience with the
Accelerator plugin (`../accelerator`,
https://github.com/atomicinnovation/accelerator), whose deterministic logic grew
into a large body of bash scripts that became hard to test, slow to change, and
error-prone — concrete evidence of the failure mode this boundary exists to
avoid. The plugin is expected to grow large, and a future backend or frontend
may need to reuse the same non-probabilistic logic the skills rely on.

The plugin therefore needs an explicit, durable boundary that assigns each kind
of work to the medium suited to it, rather than letting probabilistic and
deterministic concerns intermingle in Markdown and bash.

## Decision Drivers

- Reliability and testability of deterministic logic.
- Token cost and latency — the model should not perform mechanical work it
  cannot do reliably or cheaply.
- A clear separation of concerns that holds as the plugin scales.
- Reusability of the deterministic core by a future backend or frontend.
- Using each tool for what it is genuinely best at.

## Considered Options

1. **Skills own probabilistic work; deterministic procedural logic is delegated
   to a compiled CLI** — written in a modern, testable, dependency-managed
   language; a skill decides and orchestrates, the CLI executes the
   deterministic work.
2. **Skills do everything in-prompt** — both judgement and procedural logic live
   in Markdown via the `!` preprocessor and inline bash.
3. **Keep deterministic product logic in bash/Python scripts** (the status quo
   substrate) — no dedicated runtime CLI; skills shell out to scripts.

## Decision

We will divide labour so that **skills own only probabilistic work** (reasoning,
generation, summarisation, judgement) and **delegate all deterministic, standard
procedural logic to a compiled CLI** written in a modern, testable,
dependency-managed language. A skill decides and orchestrates; the CLI executes
the deterministic work, invoked from the skill at runtime.

This ADR records the **division of labour** only. What turns on this decision is
that the deterministic core lives in a compiled, statically typed, testable,
dependency-managed CLI — not the specific language. The concrete language (Rust)
is committed to in epic 0001 and detailed by the CLI-architecture spike (work
item 0002), and the CLI's internal structure — a thin CLI over a hexagonal
ports-and-adapters core — is a separate decision (decision 9 in epic 0001's
architecture-decision set), recorded as its own spike-dependent ADR. The existing
Python build tasks and bash scripts remain the **development tooling** and are
out of scope here (recorded as their own decisions).

We chose option 1 because it is the only option that keeps deterministic logic
testable, fast, and reliable while letting skills stay lean and focused on
judgement. Option 2 was rejected: deterministic logic in prose or inline bash is
effectively untestable, token-heavy, and non-deterministic, and it does not
scale as the plugin grows. Option 3 was rejected as the long-term home for
product logic, with Accelerator's bash body as the cautionary precedent: the
bash 3.2 floor and the absence of static typing limit robustness, the zero-setup
distribution story for scripts is weak, and scripts are not cleanly reusable by a
future backend or frontend.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Deterministic logic becomes unit-testable, fast, and free of token cost and
  model variance.
- Skills stay lean and focused on judgement, improving their clarity and
  evaluability.
- A clear, enforceable boundary scales as the plugin grows rather than accreting
  logic ad hoc.
- The compiled core is reusable by a future backend or frontend, and ships as
  zero-setup static binaries.

### Negative

- Introduces a compiled-language toolchain (Rust) and a binary
  build/distribution pipeline the plugin would not otherwise need.
- Adds a second artifact that must be kept version-coherent with the plugin.
- The skill↔CLI boundary is a new integration surface to design, test, and keep
  stable.
- Classifying work as "probabilistic" vs "deterministic" requires judgement at
  the margins.

### Neutral

- Skills invoke the CLI via the `!` preprocessor / command calls at invocation
  time.
- The existing Python invoke tasks and bash library remain in place for
  development tooling, governed by separate decisions.
- The first concrete proof of the division is the `configure` skill backed by
  the CLI (work item 0009).
