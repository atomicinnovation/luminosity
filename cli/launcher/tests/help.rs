//! Black-box tests that built-in commands stay decoupled from the release
//! manifest: `version` runs without it, and top-level `--help` degrades to the
//! built-in help when the manifest cannot be fetched.
//!
//! The manifest-derived external-subcommands section itself is unit-tested in
//! `launch::help` (`external_subcommands_section`): the binary pins the
//! embedded release key, and a test cannot sign a manifest under it, so the
//! rendered-section assertion belongs at the unit level, not here.
